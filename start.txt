python3 -m venv dev_env
source dev_env/bin/activate

 hugo server -D

 Virtual environment masking PATH:
 export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
If you encounter an error stating that the command 'hugo' is not found, it may be due to the virtual environment masking the PATH variable.
To resolve this, you can either run the command outside the virtual environment or adjust the PATH variable
to include the directory where Hugo is installed.

Reload your shell configuration to apply changes:
source ~/.zshrc

If you activated a Python virtual environment (source dev_env/bin/activate), 
it may override your PATH. Try running hugo before activating the virtual 
environment, or use the full path: /opt/homebrew/bin/hugo server -D
